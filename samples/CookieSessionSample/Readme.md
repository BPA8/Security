## Sample: Cookie authentication with session

This sample demonstrates the mechanism of integrating cookie authentication with session. The mechanism is particularly useful in the scenarios where the size of the cookie is sensitive:
1. The user agent sets a limit on the size of the cookie.
2. The network limitation prefers a smaller cookie.
